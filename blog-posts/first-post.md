This is the full body of the blog post. Here you can go into much more detail than the short excerpt shown on the homepage.

Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers. It just means you, the developer, don't have to manage them. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions handle all the infrastructure for you.

### Key Benefits

* **Cost-Effective:** You only pay for the compute time you consume.
* **Scalability:** The platform automatically scales your application up or down based on demand.
* **Focus on Code:** You can focus on writing application logic instead of managing servers.
